                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>During the pandemic when many people were isolated at home, 
               they started looking for companions in their pets. 
               As a result, in 2020 and 2021, pet stores and retailers saw 
               a massive boost in sales. The demand for pets is still high 
               but many potential buyers do not want to make a trip to their 
               local pet store to buy one. What do they do? With your endorsement, 
               they would use our unique pet adoption website that, in collaboration 
               with local pet stores and pet adoption agencies, will allow clients 
               to view the stores’ collection of pets, select one for adoption and 
               have their new animal companion delivered to their doors all without 
               leaving the comfort of their couches.</p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>Our research shows that the majority of our potential clients
               are single. This is because, as the pandemic continues to isolate
               us, they are searching for an animal companion to keep them company.
               Our research also indicates that our potential clients are either
               young (18-25 years old) or elderly (60+ years old). Therefore, the
               young and the elderly who are single will be our target audience.
               Here are two scenarios showing why potential customers will visit
               our site:
                </p>

                    will give them a detailed catalogue showing their options.

                    <li>
                    They will be looking for a way to adopt a pet without having to leave
                    their homes. Our site will give them the option of choosing to have their
                    chosen pet delivered to their doors.
