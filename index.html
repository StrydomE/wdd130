        <p>Hi! My name is Erin Strydom and you are the first
            web page that I have ever created. <strong>Congratulations!</strong><br/>
            There are a few things that you need to know about me.
            I am from South Africa. I'm the eldest of three children.
            I have just returned home from serving a mission in
            <em>Mozambique.</em><br/> Here is a list of things that I enjoy doing:
        </p>

            <li>Hiking.</li>
            <li>Reading.</li>
            <li>Cooking & baking.</li>
            <li>Learning new languages.</li>
            <li>Spending time with my friends and family.</li>
