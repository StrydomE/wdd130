            <h3 class="item">Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of the website will be to attract customers
               for The Rapids Rafting Company. They provide high quality
               whitewater rafting adventures for people of all ages and
               levels of experience/ability. Safety is their number one
               priority, and they pride themselves on the fact that they
               have only had two accidents in their fifty year existence.
               Their rafting adventures/trails are affordable, they
               employ experienced guides and their equipment is of the
               highest quality. Our website will need to include all of
               these details, honing in on their safety standards,
               affordability and their quality services.

            <h3 class="item">Target Audience</h3>
            <p>Our demographic research shows that customers of whitewater
               rafting companies are generally below the age of 40, have a
               moderate income, Class II experience and travel in groups.
               Families with adolescent children are also frequent customers.
               This is our target audience and we need to cater for both
               adventerous youth and families. The demographic also shows
               that most people will access our website from a computer
               or laptop. Here are a few scenarios describing why these two 
               groups of people would visit our site:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>They will want to book reservations, usually for the
                    weekend or vacation trips. Our website will need to
                    offer them a way to make this reservation.
                </li>
                <li>After booking their reservations, they will most likely
                    wish to pay online. Our website needs to give them the
                    option of securely paying online.
                </li>
                <li>They will visit our website with questions concerning
                    the quality and safety standards of the company's
                    service. Our website needs to provide this information, 
                    including all of the company's safety and quality
                    certifications. A few testimonials will also be useful.
                </li>
                <li>They will also be curious as to the variety of services
                    that the company offers. Our website will need to give 
                    a detailed description of the various trails/routes that
                    the company offers. We should also include the levels of
                    experience for each route/trail.
